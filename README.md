# dots
my dots :)

# install
you can completely replace your clearly inferior dots with the install script `apply_dots`, which will:
- create symlinks from the dots directory to the home directory
- check for existing files and ask to overwrite

**NOTE:** to use the `apply_dots` script, you must clone this repository to `~/.dots` (will be fixed soon)

# dependencies
check out dependencies.txt

**NOTE:** I currently use [ibhangwan's fork of picom](https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom) to support both dual kawase blur and rounded corners.
